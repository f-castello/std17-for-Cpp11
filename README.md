# What's this?
A quick implementation of the [`std::any`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/any) (*heap*) and [`std::variant`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant) (*stack*) C++17 classes for C++11, featuring a heavy use of the **SFINAE** rule applied to templates.
A trivial example is additionally provided along with the source header of both the above classes, which have ultimately been enclosed within the custom \`std17\` namespace [tested on **GCC** and debugged with **LLDB**].
